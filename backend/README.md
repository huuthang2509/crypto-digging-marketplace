# Crypto Digging Marketplace

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Starting the local server:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Deploying contracts script:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
